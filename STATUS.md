# ai-agent-learnings - Status

## Current State
This repository stores project-agnostic learnings for AI agents. It is sourced from `~/Dropbox/learnings`, initialized as a git repository, and pushed to GitHub at `https://github.com/qudent/ai-agent-learnings` on branch `main`.

## Active Goals
- [x] Add repo metadata (`README.md`) with setup description and core global guidance excerpt
- [x] Add a project status board (`STATUS.md`)
- [x] Complete initial git commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Maintain learnings as cross-project guidance (no project-specific runbooks)

## Blockers
- None

## Recent Results
- Added `README.md` with purpose, setup, and selected passage from global `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`.
- Added this `STATUS.md` to track state and keep agent coordination lightweight.
- Created root commit `7d4461e` and pushed `main` to `origin`.

## Next Steps
1. Keep learnings files updated when new cross-project lessons are discovered.
2. Rewrite `STATUS.md` whenever state changes meaningfully.
