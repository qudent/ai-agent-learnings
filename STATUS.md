# ai-agent-learnings - Status

## Current State
This repository stores project-agnostic learnings for AI agents. It is sourced from `~/Dropbox/learnings` and is being versioned and published to GitHub as `qudent/ai-agent-learnings`.

## Active Goals
- [x] Add repo metadata (`README.md`) with setup description and core global guidance excerpt
- [x] Add a project status board (`STATUS.md`)
- [ ] Complete initial git commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Maintain learnings as cross-project guidance (no project-specific runbooks)

## Blockers
- None

## Recent Results
- Added `README.md` with purpose, setup, and selected passage from global `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`.
- Added this `STATUS.md` to track state and keep agent coordination lightweight.

## Next Steps
1. Initialize git repository in `~/Dropbox/learnings`.
2. Commit current files.
3. Create and push `qudent/ai-agent-learnings`.
