# ai-agent-learnings - Status

## Current State
Learnings repo now captures reusable agent operating guidance across:
- experiment execution/antipattern prevention,
- Vast.ai babysitting/teardown policy,
- agent coordination with per-project `STATUS.md`,
- Modal inference setup/debug patterns.

## Active Goals
- [x] Keep learnings project-agnostic
- [x] Encode anti-pattern interrupts
- [x] Encode Vast operational/babysitter policy
- [x] Encode coordination pattern (`STATUS.md` as source of truth)
- [x] Add Modal inference reliability guidance
- [ ] Calibrate monitoring thresholds from additional unattended runs

## Blockers
- None

## Recent Results
- Added `modal-inference.md` with practical setup/debug rules.
- Updated `README.md` file index to include Modal learnings.
- Maintained project-agnostic scope (no one-off repo paths/commands).

## Next Steps
1. Refine Modal guidance after more multi-model runs.
2. Keep all new learnings concise, actionable, and stack-agnostic.
3. Continue rewriting files instead of append-only drift.
